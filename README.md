1. Mocked up application
- Decided to refactor SBA 407 (HTML & CSS), which made mockups very fast

2. Identified necessary components
- Was unsure how granular to get when figuring out how many components were needed, especially with the tables/sections. 

2.5. Created basic file structure in order to:
- Break down each component by what information it would need to contain 
- Assess necessary data flow between components
- Assess where states might be needed & located

3. Created a static layout

4. Determined minimal state representation

5. Determined which components should own what state

6. Added Inverse Data Flow?
